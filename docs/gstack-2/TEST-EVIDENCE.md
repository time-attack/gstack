# GStack 2.0 test evidence

## Candidate checkpoint — 2026-07-20

These results describe the working tree at the documentation checkpoint. They
are deliberately narrower than the P0 release matrix. Commands that need a
provider account, signed physical app, native OS, or live host are not marked
pass from deterministic, offline, or filesystem-only evidence.

| Command / probe | Observed result | What it proves / does not prove |
|---|---|---|
| Earlier focused macOS `bun test test/gstack2-*.test.ts` candidate run | **Exit 0: 136 pass / 0 fail**, 1,128 assertions across 15 files. Log: `/tmp/gstack2-test-command-candidate-final2.log`. | Historical focused checkpoint retained rather than overwritten. |
| Current macOS direct `bun test --timeout 60000 test/gstack2-*.test.ts` | **Exit 0: 218 pass / 0 fail**, 2,229 assertions across 20 files. | Current routing, runtime, privacy, installer, upgrade, parity, browser-provider setup, and adversarial-harness surface is green. The `test:gstack2` wrapper's generated-cleanliness precheck remains a commit-time gate, so this row records the direct underlying suite rather than relabeling that wrapper. |
| `bun test --timeout 30000 test/gstack2-skills.test.ts test/gstack2-skills-routing.test.ts` after regeneration | **Exit 0: 3 pass / 0 fail**, 81 assertions. | The pinned corpus/parity test and both 25-scenario structured-routing tests are green. This remains structural/fixture evidence, not specialist live execution. |
| `bun run scripts/gstack2/run-parity.ts`, 2026-07-17 rerun | **Exit 0: 4,681 checks passed**; 55 modules, 16 sections, 25 scenarios, 16 regressions, 78 assets. | Current source/render/provenance/contract/asset/fixture parity is green. It is deterministic parity, not live-host behavior. |
| Earlier regenerated structural parity checkpoint | **Exit 0: 2,403 checks passed** with the then-current 55/16/25/16/45 inventory. | Historical candidate checkpoint before later thin-prelude and asset coverage; superseded by the current 4,681-check rerun. |
| Earlier combined runtime/parity run before regeneration | **Exit 1: 20 pass / 1 fail**, 161 assertions. All 18 runtime tests and both routing tests passed; parity hit the default 5s timeout. A separate long-timeout attempt reported 29 stale-generation checks. | Preserved as history: generator inputs had changed. The post-regeneration rows above supersede the parity failure, not the runtime results. |
| `bun run scripts/gstack2/semantic-parity.ts` and `bun test test/gstack2-semantic-parity.test.ts` | **Deterministic corpus green: 295 checks**, 14 suites, 15 executions, all 15 dimensions, 16 carved sections, and nine authority-policy unit cases, including unsupported numeric claims. | Exact source-body and semantic-signature evidence is the primary reproducible oracle. The policy units consume hand-authored semantic operation envelopes; they are deterministic policy evidence, not behavioral-adversarial proof. |
| Retained Claude Haiku live semantic transcripts | **Three retained samples, all classified `REGRESSION`.** Two samples used now-obsolete visible-wrapper prompts. The current office-hours sample also penalizes independently sampled omissions even though those details remain byte-preserved in the candidate source. | Live-model sampling is supplemental and currently not green. These results must not be retried until favorable, cherry-picked, or used to overrule deterministic source loss. See [SEMANTIC-PARITY.md](./SEMANTIC-PARITY.md). |
| Installed-host adversarial v1 | **FAILED.** The immutable v1 slash-invocation artifact is retained. | Unfavorable activation/classifier evidence; not a behavioral pass. See [eval overview](../../evals/host-adversarial/README.md). |
| Installed-host adversarial v2 | **FAILED.** QA passed, while debug, review, and ship were false negatives from the v2 read-only-Git warning classifier. | All four dispatchers activated, but the top-level run failed and must stay failed. Immutable artifact: [`2026-07-17T04-09-01-809Z-3d23a270.json`](../../evals/host-adversarial/runs/2026-07-17T04-09-01-809Z-3d23a270.json), SHA-256 `7ab15ea575cb9a634b7d00212dd9d74902b1188281ae6a503a32ccf382facbf5`. |
| Installed-host adversarial v3 offline harness | **18 pass / 0 fail**, 111 assertions. | The classifier fix and offline harness are covered. This deterministic result does not override the failed paid live run. |
| Installed-host adversarial v3 paid live run | **FAILED 3/4.** Debug, QA, and ship passed; review failed compound inspection. This was the one-shot run, with zero retries. | Unfavorable evidence is immutable and must not be retried or relabeled. Artifact: [`2026-07-17T19-48-45Z-v3-live-gpt-5-4.json`](../../evals/host-adversarial/runs/2026-07-17T19-48-45Z-v3-live-gpt-5-4.json), SHA-256 `fcffdf2b0ee7bb9ac1351e246546af2cd352779bda7b1f8dc4a08f51fc66ef2f`. |
| Six-skill catalog measurement after regeneration | Six names/descriptions total 982 characters, about 246 four-character token-equivalents; baseline correctly parsed catalog was about 1,100. | 77.6% reduction, above the 75% gate. Re-measure if frontmatter changes. The buggy 4,214 baseline estimate is not used. |
| `bun test ios-qa/daemon/test` | **95 pass / 0 fail**, 229 assertions. | Covers daemon regressions including malformed device JSON, hardware-UDID/CoreDevice selection, bounded proxy timeout, and expected-bundle mutation header. It is not a signed-app live pass. |
| Focused DebugBridge/template build tests | **33 pass / 0 fail** in the candidate run, including Swift debug compilation/XCTest and Release symbol absence. | Static/build evidence for debug-only bridge wiring; still not an installed physical-app journey. |
| Earlier physical-iOS setup attempts | **Incomplete, not passes:** the preflight recorded 9 pass / 0 fail / 1 deploy check skipped and 29 assertions; one target returned `signing_unavailable`; the legacy iPhone10,6 target returned `device_not_wired` / CoreDevice error 1011; a later authorized phone reached tunnel setup but its first session-acquire socket closed. | Immutable historical setup/partial evidence. The later pass does not erase or relabel these attempts. |
| Physical-device smoke, 2026-07-20 | **PASS:** 12/12 harness checks and all five required live iterations. Release symbols were absent; signing, safe in-place install, launch, CoreDevice bootstrap, boot-token rotation, five session acquire/release cycles, ten screenshots, accessibility reads, coordinate taps, bundle checks, state cleanup, tunnel shutdown, and temporary-workspace cleanup passed. | Closes the physical-iPhone evidence layer for the tested wired paired `iPhone17,1`; it is not a claim about every iPhone or iOS release. Redacted artifact: [`ios-physical-device-2026-07-20T17-49-19-302Z.json`](./evidence/ios-physical-device-2026-07-20T17-49-19-302Z.json). |
| Context.dev contract (`gstack2-runtime-context.test.ts`) | **22 pass / 0 fail**, 139 assertions. | Persists explicit host/local-browser/none choices without consent, rejects private/credential URLs and request material plus private DNS, proves zero lookup/fetch before mode+consent, validates documented endpoint paths and exact failure taxonomy, and makes search typed unsupported without network. |
| `gstack context smoke --url https://www.context.dev --json` | **PASS:** the official `/web/scrape/markdown` endpoint returned `ok: true` and credit metadata. | The verified key entered through protected stdin/environment worked. The temporary secrets file was mode `0600`, the isolated home was removed, and the safe output did not contain the key. Committed redacted artifact: [`evals/context-dev/live-smoke-2026-07-17.json`](../../evals/context-dev/live-smoke-2026-07-17.json). |
| Standard installer matrix | **PASS: 510/510 checks**, 18 install cases, two removal cases, `skills` CLI 1.5.19. | Project/global installs pass for seven hosts, including Kimi Code CLI through the standard `.agents/skills` path; selected-skill and opt-in compatibility-alias cases, copies, and hashes pass. This remains installer/filesystem evidence. Committed artifact: [`evals/installation/install-matrix.json`](../../evals/installation/install-matrix.json). |
| Standard Agent Skills install + actual runtime-absent Codex invocation | **PASS.** Root `--list` returned exactly six. The selected source was `time-attack/gstack/skills --skill qa`; despite `skills` 1.5.19's pre-filter display counting hidden aliases, exactly one skill (`qa`) installed byte-identically. Codex exited 0 with `gstack` absent, reported `NEEDS_SETUP` and one approval prompt, changed no files, and created no runtime/browser/external-service activity. | Closes the actual-host runtime-absent judgment gate for Codex without overstating seven-host UI coverage. Artifact: [`standard-codex-runtime-absent-2026-07-17.json`](../../evals/installation/standard-codex-runtime-absent-2026-07-17.json). |
| `bun test --timeout 30000 test/gstack2-runtime-install.test.ts` | **Exit 0: 41 pass / 0 fail.** | Managed allowlist, hashes, spaces, source/internal-link rejection, production-only frozen dependencies, deterministic exact Sharp/ngrok platform closure, native-load rollback smoke, atomic browser-choice rollback/recovery, provider-aware stable launchers, wrapper neutrality, and state-preserving uninstall pass. |
| `bun test --timeout 30000 test/gstack2-runtime-setup-ux.test.ts` | **Exit 0: 29 pass / 0 fail.** | Explicit managed/installed/later browser selection fails closed before network, local options do not mutate, signed previews remain provider-identical across same- and cross-release capability additions, developer-source provider switches replace the exact retained set, visible extension Chromium remains managed-only, and launcher/doctor paths honor the persisted selection. This is deterministic local evidence, not native Windows or every installed Chrome-family build. |
| Deterministic clean macOS arm64 managed runtime bundle audit | **110 components, 1,829 files, 450,044,315 bytes, 50 capability launchers.** | This is a platform-specific bundle measurement, not a universal byte count; platform-native package payloads differ. Setup includes the Sharp/ngrok closure and excludes the development-only Claude Agent SDK. The Hugging Face sidecar is outside the bundle and its package is development-only, so production setup installs neither its inference runtime nor model weights; the L4 capability reports unavailable. The standard skill installer remains Markdown-only. Committed artifact: [`evals/runtime-bundle/darwin-arm64.json`](../../evals/runtime-bundle/darwin-arm64.json); reproduce with `bun run scripts/gstack2/audit-runtime-bundle.ts --output evals/runtime-bundle/darwin-arm64.json`. |
| Earlier declared Linux Dev Container plus `bun run test:gstack2` inside it | **Exit 0: 136 pass / 0 fail, 1,127 assertions across 15 files.** Log: `/tmp/gstack2-devcontainer-gate-candidate-final4.log`. | Historical container checkpoint retained rather than overwritten; the current 150-test container result is recorded in the native-CI row below. |
| `scripts/gstack2/runtime-install-smoke.sh` in the clean Linux arm64 container | **Pass:** production-only frozen dependencies installed with the development Agent SDK and Hugging Face/ONNX runtime absent; the managed Anthropic SDK, Sharp, and ngrok imports passed; prebuilt capabilities rebuilt; setup/doctor/version/design/PDF passed; a local-browser journey and Sharp full-page screenshot passed; uninstall preserved state. | Proves a source copy with spaces can build and complete the managed runtime lifecycle without Git history, an executable local-model stack, or Darwin-only iOS artifacts. It is not native Windows evidence. |
| Runtime lifecycle and external-effect matrix | **Pass:** real filesystem/subprocess tests cover clean install/uninstall, paths with spaces, source symlinks and internal-link rejection, macOS read-only reporting, interrupted-pointer rollback, crash-journal repair, last-known-good launcher recovery, and an actual local Git push that executes at most once across resume. | Closes the named local filesystem/recovery/idempotency gates. Aggregate cancellation evidence is recorded separately below. |
| `bun test design/test` | **101 pass / 0 fail**, 381 assertions. | The retained design suite is green and is also included in the later uninterrupted broad pass. |
| `bun test make-pdf/test` plus combined-fixture render | **189 pass / 0 fail, 398 assertions;** four PDF pages rendered to PNG and visually inspected with no detected layout defect. | Retained strict PDF tests and a live internal render are green on this macOS host. Cross-platform visual equivalence remains a separate platform claim. |
| Diagram suites | **51 pass / 0 fail / 1 skip**, 120 assertions; the opt-in paid lane recorded two skips. | Offline Mermaid/SVG/PNG/Excalidraw coverage is green. Skipped paid-provider cases are not live evidence. |
| Isolated local-browser journey plus stop regression | Navigation, snapshot, screenshot, and status passed; stop returned success and left no observed process leak. `browse/test/stop-ack-before-shutdown.test.ts` is **2 pass / 0 fail**. | Provides one real local Chromium journey and a focused regression for acknowledging stop/restart before delayed shutdown. The complete browser suite is included in the later broad pass. |
| Live local-browser SIGINT aggregate | **PASS.** An isolated local-file journey completed `goto`, `status`, and `snapshot`; SIGINT produced an in-memory authenticated `503`, reduced five owned processes to zero, and left no listener, root credential state, credential-shaped file, or device session. The unrelated browser daemon survived. Focused regression: 34 pass / 0 fail, 62 assertions. | Closes the requested aggregate process/listener/state/credential cleanup gate without claiming device interaction. Artifact: [`evals/browser/cancellation-2026-07-17.json`](../../evals/browser/cancellation-2026-07-17.json). |
| Native CI run `29615621805`, commit `a8a5fa1a` | **PASS:** installer 470/470; macOS 150/0/1,189; Ubuntu 150/0/1,189; native Windows 150/0/1,145; Dev Container 150/0/1,188. All native installer-discovery steps found exactly six skills. | Complete native matrix evidence. Sanitized artifact: [`evals/ci/native-2026-07-17.json`](../../evals/ci/native-2026-07-17.json). Runs `29608904265`, `29611504979`, `29611757175`, `29612056517` (cancelled), `29613668419`, `29614448170`, and `29614899434` remain superseded diagnostics. |
| Earlier `bun test` strict singleton checkpoint | **Exit 0: 6,240 pass / 226 expected skips / 0 fail**, 25,449 assertions across 383 files. Log: `/tmp/gstack2-full-singleton-final-committed.log`. | Historical broad checkpoint retained rather than overwritten. |
| Current `bun test` through the strict singleton runner | **Exit 0: 6,255 pass / 226 expected skips / 0 fail**, 25,509 assertions; 384/384 shard headers and terminal single-file summaries. | One uninterrupted current-head macOS broad pass. Expected skips are provider, credential, Poppler-environment, paid, or model-sidecar gates declared by their tests; external/live evidence remains separate. |
| Earlier local `bun run test:windows` singleton checkpoint | **Exit 0: 2,815 pass / 57 expected skips / 0 fail**, 8,586 assertions across 213 files. Log: `/tmp/gstack2-windows-singleton-final-committed.log`. | Historical curated-lane checkpoint retained rather than overwritten. |
| Current local `bun run test:windows` through singleton shards | **Exit 0: 2,829 pass / 57 expected skips / 0 fail**, 8,648 assertions; all 214 selected files completed. | The current curated Windows-safe subset is locally green. Native Windows is independently green in run `29615621805`. |
| Forbidden production-scope audit | Production dependencies and the 110-component managed bundle contain no cloud-browser provider, Hugging Face/ONNX inference runtime, model weights, or alternative physical-iOS backend. Transformers remains development-only for retained tests; CoreDevice/`devicectl` is the sole physical-iOS path. | Deterministic dependency/bundle/backend evidence. It does not substitute for native-platform, signed-device, or live-provider behavior. |

### Required final command ledger

Append exact exit codes, aggregate counts, environment/version metadata, and
artifact/log locations for all of the following before changing status to
`DONE`:

```text
bun run gen:gstack2
bun run test:gstack2
bun run scripts/gstack2/run-parity.ts
bun run scripts/gstack2/semantic-parity.ts
bun run build
bun test
bun run test:windows
bun test design/test
bun test ios-qa/daemon/test
host UI/process launch for six installer-verified hosts
passing live installed-host adversarial gate (live v3 one-shot is retained failed evidence)
runtime-absent judgment through an actual host invocation (Codex passed; broader host UI coverage remains)
macOS + Linux + native Windows + Dev Container
local browser live journey + cancellation/leak cleanup (passed)
PDF strict + diagram suites
Context.dev verified-key public-page smoke
physical signed-iPhone five-check loop + Release symbol check (passed on 2026-07-20; retain earlier failures separately)
upgrade/fail/recover/rollback/uninstall end-to-end
```

The focused results above should remain in the ledger even after a later pass;
record the newer SHA/time beside the newer result rather than overwriting the
history.

## Baseline evidence — 2026-07-16

Scope: detached base worktree `/tmp/gstack2-baseline.e2qk7F`, commit
`bb57306d98c97011b0919c6132705a15b1579781`, captured 2026-07-16. These are
baseline observations only; no result below was produced by the GStack 2.0
implementation.

## Command ledger

| Command | Evidence | Observed result |
|---|---|---|
| `bun install` | `/tmp/gstack2-baseline-logs/bun-install.log` | Completed; Bun 1.3.14 reported 297 packages installed. |
| `bun run gen:skill-docs --host all` | `/tmp/gstack2-baseline-logs/gen-all.log` | Reached the final GBrain token table and `llms.txt` summary (`55 skills, 76 browse commands`); no error marker is present. |
| `bun run skill:check` | `/tmp/gstack2-baseline-logs/skill-check.log` | **Exit 1**: `claude/SKILL.md — generated file missing`. The same run reported 54/54 outputs for each of the 10 hosts and fresh generated files, but the missing primary output keeps the command red. |
| `bun run build` | `/tmp/gstack2-baseline-logs/build.log` | Reached the final Node-compatible server bundle (`server-node.mjs`, 0.83 MB); no error marker is present. |
| `bun test` | `/tmp/gstack2-baseline-logs/bun-test.log` | **Not green and incompletely terminated**: 4,292 `(pass)` markers, 488 `(skip)` markers, seven explicit `(fail)` markers, and one unhandled between-tests error. The capture ends after `browse/test/findport.test.ts` without Bun's aggregate summary or exit record. |
| `bun run test:windows` | `/tmp/gstack2-baseline-logs/test-windows.log` | **Exit 1** on shard 5/20. The runner selected 189 Windows-safe files and excluded 155. Completed shard summaries contain 593 passes, 14 skips, and one failed test before the run stopped. |
| `bun test design/test` | `/tmp/gstack2-baseline-logs/design-test.log` | **Not green**: 64 pass markers and one explicit failure. The log ends on daemon shutdown without an aggregate summary or exit record. |
| `bun test ios-qa/daemon/test` | `/tmp/gstack2-baseline-logs/ios-daemon-test.log` | **Pass**: 91 pass, 0 fail, 217 assertions across 10 files. |

`/tmp/gstack2-baseline-logs/git-status-after.txt` is empty, recording no status
entries after the runner. The logs are external audit artifacts and are not
vendored into the repository.

## Pre-existing `bun test` failures

The broad-suite log records these seven explicit failures:

1. `gstack-decision-search --recent / --scope / datamark > --scope filters by scope`
   expected output containing `branch-call` and received an empty string.
2. `gstack-gbrain-detect > emits valid JSON even when nothing is configured`
   expected status 0 and received 127.
3. `gstack-gbrain-detect > reports gstack_brain_git: true when GSTACK_HOME has a .git dir`
   attempted to parse empty output and raised `Unexpected EOF`.
4. `gstack-gbrain-detect > reports gbrain_config + engine when ~/.gbrain/config.json exists`
   attempted to parse empty output and raised `Unexpected EOF`.
5. `gstack-gbrain-detect > malformed config returns null engine, does not crash`
   expected status 0 and received 127.
6. `gstack-gbrain-detect > detects a mocked gbrain binary on PATH and reports its version`
   expected status 0 and received 127.
7. `resolve-user-slug fallback chain > persists resolution to user_slug_at_<hash> on first call`
   expected a hashed key and observed `user_slug_at_local: persisttest`.

Separately, `test/gbrain-refresh-install-render.test.ts` raised an unhandled
between-tests error: `Could not locate gbrain-refresh ok) branch`. Because the
log has no terminal Bun summary, the marker counts are evidence of what ran,
not a claim that all files were reached or that the command had only those
failures.

## Other pre-existing failures

- `skill:check`: the primary `claude/SKILL.md` generated file was absent; the
  script explicitly exited with code 1.
- Windows-safe shard 5:
  `Source-level guard: terminal-agent > lazy spawn: claude PTY is spawned in message handler, not on upgrade`
  still looked for `spawnClaude(`, while the source excerpt used
  `maybeSpawnPty(...)`. The shard reported 82 pass / 1 skip / 1 fail and the
  remaining 15 shards did not run.
- Design target:
  `generateVariant Retry-After handling > HTTP-date: honors a future date with no extra leading exponential`
  expected a delay of at least 2,500 ms and observed 2,246 ms.

## What this evidence does not establish

- It does not establish a green baseline.
- It does not establish that GStack 2.0 preserves behavior; replacement
  contract tests have not yet been implemented.
- It does not turn incomplete logs into passes.
- It does not attribute these failures to later changes; every failure above
  was captured from the stated base SHA before GStack 2.0 work.
