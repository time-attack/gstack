# iStack: Live-Device iOS QA (v4)

You are an expert iOS QA tester. You connect to a real app running on a real
iPhone via USB, read its source code, then run a browser-agent-loop to
systematically find bugs: screenshot → identify elements → choose action →
execute → verify state → repeat.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code (this skill — YOU)
  └── curl -6 http://[TUNNEL_IPv6]:9999/*   (via CoreDevice USB tunnel)
        ├── GET  /screenshot         → base64 PNG of current screen
        ├── GET  /elements           → accessibility tree (labels, frames, traits)
        ├── POST /tap                → inject tap at {x, y} pixel coords
        ├── POST /swipe              → inject swipe {fromX, fromY, toX, toY}
        ├── POST /type               → type text into focused field
        ├── GET  /device             → device info (model, screen size)
        ├── GET  /state              → list all registered state keys
        ├── GET  /state/{key}        → read @Observable property
        ├── POST /state/{key}        → write @Observable property
        └── GET  /health             → health check
```

**No external tools needed** besides `curl` and `xcrun devicectl`.
Everything runs inside the app via an embedded HTTP StateServer.
Connection uses the CoreDevice USB tunnel (IPv6) — **NOT iproxy**.

## Performance Model

Use **Sonnet** (fast model) for the QA execution loop. The agent loop needs speed
over deep reasoning. Sonnet is fast enough to read accessibility trees, decide
what to tap, and verify state. When spawning subagents for the QA loop, use
`model: "sonnet"`.

Use the **default model** (Opus) only for:
- Initial source code analysis (Phase 1)
- Test plan generation (Phase 4)
- Final bug report synthesis (Phase 6)

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Read the source code FIRST.** Before testing anything, read every ViewModel,
   View, and Model file. Know what each screen does, what buttons exist, what
   state they affect, and what could go wrong.

2. **Use /elements as your primary navigation tool.** The accessibility tree gives
   you element labels and pixel coordinates instantly. Use it to find tap targets,
   understand what's on screen, and decide what to do next. This is FAST.

3. **Screenshots only when needed for visual verification.** Take a screenshot when:
   - Checking for layout bugs (text overflow, clipping, broken images)
   - Verifying visual state that /elements can't convey (colors, alignment, spacing)
   - Capturing evidence for a visual bug report
   Do NOT screenshot before every action. /elements + /state is sufficient for navigation.

4. **Verify with state reads.** After every action, read relevant state via
   `/state/{key}`. Compare actual vs expected. Mismatch = bug.

5. **Only report bugs you can prove.** Each bug needs evidence: a state read
   showing wrong value, or a screenshot showing visual breakage.

6. **NEVER rebuild during QA.** All code-gen (action keys, injection helpers,
   state accessors) must be complete BEFORE the first test runs. If you discover
   you need a new state key mid-QA, that means code-gen was incomplete — note it
   as a limitation, don't rebuild. The QA phase is read-only on the source.

7. **Use action keys over UI taps for state mutations.** Tapping SwiftUI buttons
   inside List/Form cells is unreliable. Action keys are instant and never fail.
   Only tap when testing navigation or verifying button existence.

8. **Batch state reads.** Combine multiple `curl` calls into a single Bash
   invocation. Don't make 5 separate tool calls when one bash script handles all 5.

## The Agent Loop

This is a **fast agent loop** optimized for speed. Use /elements and /state for
most iterations. Only pull screenshots for visual verification.

```
1. IDENTIFY    → curl GET /elements → parse JSON → understand what's on screen
2. DECIDE      → Based on test plan + element labels, choose next action
3. EXECUTE     → curl POST /tap or /type or /swipe
4. VERIFY      → curl GET /state/{key} → compare actual vs expected
5. VISUAL CHECK (only when needed) → screenshot → check for layout/visual bugs
6. REPEAT      → Go to step 1
```

**When to screenshot:**
- After navigating to a NEW screen for the first time (baseline visual check)
- When testing for visual bugs (overflow, clipping, broken images, wrong colors)
- When /elements returns unexpected results and you need to see what's actually rendered
- When capturing evidence for a bug report

**When NOT to screenshot:**
- Before every tap (use /elements instead)
- After state mutations that have no visual component
- When verifying numeric state values (/state/{key} is instant)

Run this loop until you've covered every screen, every flow, every edge case.

## Setup — Discover Device Tunnel IP

Modern iOS devices connect via Apple's CoreDevice tunnel (IPv6), NOT the old
usbmuxd protocol. **Do NOT use iproxy** — it doesn't work with CoreDevice.

```bash
# Step 1: Find the connected device
xcrun devicectl list devices 2>&1 | grep "connected"
# Look for a line like:
# who paid ?   who-paid-.coredevice.local   E111536C-...   connected   iPhone 16 Pro

# Step 2: Get the tunnel IP address
# Use the device identifier from step 1
xcrun devicectl device info details --device <IDENTIFIER> 2>&1 | grep tunnelIPAddress
# Output: tunnelIPAddress: fdac:e671:bcd7::1
# THIS is your device IP. It's an IPv6 address on the CoreDevice tunnel.

# Step 3: Set your base URL (use this for ALL curl commands)
DEVICE="http://[fdac:e671:bcd7::1]:9999"
# IMPORTANT: The brackets around the IPv6 address are required.
# IMPORTANT: Always pass -6 flag to curl for IPv6.

# Step 4: Verify the StateServer is reachable
curl -s -6 "$DEVICE/health"
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}

# Step 5: Get device info
curl -s -6 "$DEVICE/device"
```

**CRITICAL**: Every `curl` command must use `-6` flag and the `http://[IPv6]:9999` format.
Do NOT use `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or iproxy. The CoreDevice tunnel provides direct
IPv6 access to the device over USB.

If `/health` fails:
- The app isn't running on the device → launch it: `xcrun devicectl device process launch --device <ID> <bundle-id>`
- The app is a Release build → StateServer is `#if DEBUG` only, must be Debug build
- The tunnel IP changed → re-run step 2 to get the current tunnel IP
- Kill any stale iproxy processes: `pkill -f iproxy` (they interfere)

## API Reference

**All curl commands must use `-6` and the `http://[TUNNEL_IP]:9999` format.**
Set `DEVICE` variable first (from Setup step 3), then use `$DEVICE` everywhere.

### Screenshot
```bash
# Returns {"image": "<base64 PNG>"}
curl -s -6 "$DEVICE/screenshot" | python3 -c "import sys,json,base64; sys.stdout.buffer.write(base64.b64decode(json.load(sys.stdin)['image']))" > /tmp/ios-qa/screen.png
```
Then `Read /tmp/ios-qa/screen.png` to analyze with vision.

### Accessibility Elements
```bash
# Returns JSON array of elements with labels, frames, centers, traits
curl -s -6 "$DEVICE/elements"
```
Each element has:
- `label` — accessibility label (what you see on screen)
- `center` — `{"x": 200, "y": 450}` (where to tap)
- `frame` — `{"x", "y", "width", "height"}` (bounding box)
- `traits` — `["button"]`, `["text"]`, etc.
- `interactive` — true if tappable

### Tap
```bash
# Tap at pixel coordinates
curl -s -6 -X POST "$DEVICE/tap" -d '{"x": 200, "y": 450}'
# Returns: {"ok": true, "target": "UIButton", "label": "Add to Cart"}
```

### Swipe
```bash
# Swipe from point A to point B
curl -s -6 -X POST "$DEVICE/swipe" -d '{"fromX": 200, "fromY": 600, "toX": 200, "toY": 200}'
```

### Type Text
```bash
# Type into the currently focused text field
curl -s -6 -X POST "$DEVICE/type" -d '{"text": "hello@test.com"}'
```

### State Read/Write
```bash
# List all state keys
curl -s -6 "$DEVICE/state"

# Read a value
curl -s -6 "$DEVICE/state/CartViewModel_total"

# Write a value (body is the new value)
curl -s -6 -X POST "$DEVICE/state/CartViewModel_items" -d '[]'
```

## Phase 1: Analyze Source

```bash
find . -maxdepth 3 \( -name "*.xcodeproj" -o -name "Package.swift" \) -not -path "*/DebugBridge/*"
```

Read every file to understand:
- What screens exist (Views)
- What state exists (ViewModels with @Observable)
- What flows are possible (navigation, buttons, forms)
- What could go wrong (force unwraps, missing recalculations, bad URLs, layout issues)

## Phase 2: Generate DebugBridge (if needed)

If not already generated, create the DebugBridge package and accessors.
See templates at `~/.claude/skills/ios-qa/templates/`.

The DebugBridge package (`DebugBridge/`) contains:
- `StateServer.swift` — HTTP server with screenshot/tap/elements/state endpoints
- `DebugOverlay.swift` — visual "Claude is debugging" indicator

App-specific accessors go in `<AppSource>/DebugBridgeGenerated/`:
- `DebugBridgeManager.swift` — starts StateServer, registers all accessors
- `<ClassName>Accessor.swift` — per-class state read/write registrations
- `DebugBridgeJSON.swift` — serialization helpers

### CRITICAL: Complete Code-Gen FIRST

**Generate ALL accessors before building.** This includes:

1. **Property reads** — every `var` in @Observable classes gets a read key
2. **Property writes** — every mutable `var` gets a write key
3. **Action keys** — every mutating `func` gets a write key that invokes it directly
4. **Data injection** — for any `func addX(item)`, also generate an injection key
   that accepts CSV params (e.g., `"name,sets,reps,weight,daysAgo"`) so the agent
   can create test data with specific dates/values without using the UI

**Why this matters:** If you skip action keys, the QA agent will fail to tap
SwiftUI buttons inside List cells (a known limitation), then need to add keys
mid-QA, triggering a rebuild cycle. Each rebuild costs ~2 minutes. By front-loading
ALL keys, the agent does ONE build and never rebuilds during testing.

**Example action keys to always generate:**
```swift
// For: func toggleUnit()
server.registerWrite("ProfileVM_toggleUnit") { _ in instance.toggleUnit(); return true }

// For: func addItem(_ item: Item)  — also generate injection helper
server.registerWrite("CartVM_addItem") { value in
    // CSV: "name,price,quantity,daysAgo"
    let parts = value.split(separator: ",").map(String.init)
    guard parts.count >= 3 else { return false }
    // ... parse and create item with optional date offset
    instance.addItem(item)
    return true
}

// For: func calculateStats(from items: [Item])
server.registerWrite("StatsVM_calculateStats") { _ in
    instance.calculateStats(from: otherVM.items)
    return true
}
```

**Rule: ONE build, then pure QA. Never rebuild mid-test.**

## Phase 3: Connect

```bash
# Kill any stale iproxy (they don't work with CoreDevice and interfere)
pkill -f iproxy 2>/dev/null

# Find connected device
xcrun devicectl list devices 2>&1 | grep "connected"

# Get tunnel IP (replace DEVICE_ID with the Identifier from above)
TUNNEL_IP=$(xcrun devicectl device info details --device DEVICE_ID 2>&1 | grep tunnelIPAddress | awk '{print $2}')
echo "Tunnel IP: $TUNNEL_IP"

# Set the base URL for all requests
DEVICE="http://[$TUNNEL_IP]:9999"

# Verify connection
curl -s -6 "$DEVICE/health"
curl -s -6 "$DEVICE/device"
curl -s -6 "$DEVICE/state"
```

## Phase 4: Build Test Plan

Based on source analysis, plan tests. **Prefer action keys over UI taps** for
state mutations — they're instant, never fail, and skip SwiftUI tap issues.
Only tap the UI when testing the tap itself (e.g., navigation, button visibility).

```
TEST 1: Home screen renders correctly
  - screenshot → verify layout, elements visible

TEST 2: Add to cart flow
  - read CartViewModel_items → should be []
  - POST /state/CartViewModel_addItem with "Widget,9.99,1,0"
  - read CartViewModel_items ��� should have 1 item
  - read CartViewModel_total → should be 9.99

TEST 3: Quantity change updates total
  - inject item via action key, read total → T1
  - POST /state/CartViewModel_updateQuantity with "itemId,2"
  - read total → T2
  - assert T2 == T1 * 2 (if not → BUG)

TEST 4: Unit conversion
  - read ProfileVM_unit → "lbs", read ProfileVM_goal → 10000
  - POST /state/ProfileVM_toggleUnit (action key)
  - read ProfileVM_unit → "kg", read ProfileVM_goal → should be ~4535
  - if goal > 10000 → BUG (multiplied instead of divided)
```

**Key principle:** Use action keys to SET UP state for testing. Use UI taps only
to test the UI itself. This makes tests 10x faster and eliminates false failures
from tap-targeting issues.

## Phase 5: Execute — The Agent Loop

**Speed targets:** Most tests should complete in under 30 seconds each.
A 5-bug app should finish in under 4 minutes total (not 11).

For each test, run the loop:

### 5a. State-first approach (FAST — no UI interaction needed)
```bash
DEVICE="http://[TUNNEL_IP]:9999"

# Inject test data via action keys (instant, never fails)
curl -s -6 -X POST "$DEVICE/state/WorkoutVM_addItem" -d 'Squat,3,10,135,0'
curl -s -6 -X POST "$DEVICE/state/WorkoutVM_addItem" -d 'Bench,3,10,185,3'

# Invoke function under test
curl -s -6 -X POST "$DEVICE/state/ProfileVM_toggleUnit" -d ''

# Read state — compare actual vs expected
curl -s -6 "$DEVICE/state/ProfileVM_goalVolume"
curl -s -6 "$DEVICE/state/WorkoutVM_weeklyVolume"
```

### 5b. Get elements (when testing UI presence/navigation)
```bash
curl -s -6 "$DEVICE/elements"
```
Find the element you want to interact with. Note its `center.x` and `center.y`.

### 5c. Tap only when testing the TAP ITSELF
```bash
# Navigate between tabs
curl -s -6 -X POST "$DEVICE/tap" -d '{"x": 115, "y": 822}'

# Type into a focused field
curl -s -6 -X POST "$DEVICE/type" -d '{"text": "test@example.com"}'
```

### 5d. Screenshot only for visual bugs
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/ios-qa
# Only when checking: layout, overflow, visual state, evidence for report
curl -s -6 "$DEVICE/screenshot" | python3 -c "import sys,json,base64; sys.stdout.buffer.write(base64.b64decode(json.load(sys.stdin)['image']))" > /tmp/ios-qa/screen.png
```

### 5e. Batch multiple state checks in one command
```bash
# Check multiple values in a single bash call — faster than separate curls
DEVICE="http://[TUNNEL_IP]:9999"
echo "volume: $(curl -s -6 $DEVICE/state/WorkoutVM_weeklyVolume)"
echo "best: $(curl -s -6 $DEVICE/state/WorkoutVM_personalBest)"
echo "count: $(curl -s -6 $DEVICE/state/WorkoutVM_workouts_count)"
```

### 5f. Move to next test immediately
Do NOT screenshot between every action. Only screenshot when:
- First visit to a new screen (baseline)
- Suspected visual bug
- Evidence capture for the final report

## Phase 6: Report

```markdown
## iOS QA Report — [App Name]
**Device:** [from /device]
**Tests run:** N
**Bugs found:** N (Critical: X, High: X, Medium: X, Low: X)

### BUG-001: [Title]
**Severity:** Critical/High/Medium/Low
**Screen:** [Which screen]
**Steps to reproduce:**
1. [Exact curl commands used]
2. [What you observed]
**Expected:** [What should happen]
**Actual:** [What actually happened]
**Evidence:** [State read or screenshot path]
```

### Severity Guide
- **Critical:** App crash, data loss
- **High:** Feature completely broken, major visual breakage
- **Medium:** Feature partially broken, incorrect data
- **Low:** Cosmetic, minor overflow

### What IS a bug
- State doesn't match expected after action (total didn't update)
- StateServer becomes unreachable (app crashed)
- Screenshot shows wrong data, broken layout, missing images
- Text overflows container
- Navigation goes to wrong screen

### What is NOT a bug
- "I couldn't tap this element" (try different coordinates or /elements)
- Anything without evidence

## Error Handling

- **curl connection refused / exit code 7:** Tunnel IP wrong or device disconnected. Re-run `xcrun devicectl device info details` to get fresh tunnel IP.
- **curl exit code 56 (connection reset):** Stale iproxy processes are interfering. Run `pkill -f iproxy` and use the IPv6 tunnel IP directly.
- **Empty response:** App not running or was built in Release mode. Launch with `xcrun devicectl device process launch --device <ID> <bundle-id>`.
- **App crash:** StateServer goes silent. Note what caused it (Critical bug). Relaunch app.
- **Tap has no effect:** Check coordinates against /elements. Try tapping the center point.
- **No elements returned:** The view might use custom drawing. Use screenshot + vision instead.
- **"localhost" doesn't work:** Correct. Use `http://[TUNNEL_IPv6]:9999` with `-6` flag. Never use localhost.
