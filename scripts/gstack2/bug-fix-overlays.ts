    body: `### Proportional planning for the printed build scale

The /plan dispatcher prints a \`Scale:\` header line classified from fifteen build-scale vectors (its Build scale section). This rule authorizes every planning and review specialist to size its machinery to that scale while keeping every STOP gate and approval boundary; a polite user answering every question is not evidence the full machinery is wanted, and the user can always ask for the complete treatment.

The binding scale comes from the first available source: the printed \`Scale:\` header, a chain handoff that names a scale or time box, or on-the-spot classification from the prompt and cheap repository evidence. An explicit user time constraint is a ceiling, not one vector among fifteen: work that must fit one sitting caps the scale at \`session\`, and a day-or-two deadline caps it at \`hobby\`, regardless of higher vectors. A chained invocation inherits the upstream scale and time box without re-asking, and every handoff it emits carries them forward.

- \`session\` and \`hobby\`: batch every question the initial prompt left unanswered into one AskUserQuestion round (two rounds for hobby); skip web or landscape research, outside voices, second opinions, and visual sketches unless the user asks (privacy gates are unchanged whenever they run); cap any adversarial or spec review loop at one iteration; keep the decision artifact near one page with next steps sized in hours (session) or days (hobby), never a phased multi-week roadmap or a distribution plan the user did not ask for.
- \`project\`: run the specialist's default workflow, batching question rounds where its source authorizes smart skips; size the roadmap in weeks.
- \`product\` and \`venture\`: the full specialist workflow and its complete question pressure apply; this rule removes nothing.

The scale also fixes a chain-wide question budget — a ceiling on individual questions (not rounds) counted across the entire invocation and everything it chains into, reviews included: five at \`session\` (a hackathon demo or a one-sitting toy gets five questions, total, ever), eight at \`hobby\`, twelve at \`project\`, uncapped at \`product\` and \`venture\`. Every handoff carries the scale, the time box, and the questions already spent; the receiving specialist deducts from the remaining budget, never restarts it. A specialist whose remaining budget is zero infers the answer from the prompt, the repository, and stated constraints, states the inference and its default in one line, and proceeds — it does not ask. Approval STOP gates (approve/revise the plan, authorize a mutation) are outside the budget; everything else, including "which option do you prefer" refinements, spends it. Spend the budget on the questions whose wrong answer is most expensive to reverse, earliest.
- Never run a questioning round merely to classify scale. Classify from the prompt and cheap repository evidence, defaulting unknown vectors low; a specialist's own later questions may raise the scale mid-session, and an upgrade restores the full workflow from that point.

Review specialists spend question rounds on decisions, not ceremony — at every scale, and sharpest at \`session\`/\`hobby\`:

- When the handoff or prompt names the review target unambiguously, print it on the Target line and proceed. Re-confirming a target the chain already fixed is not a STOP gate; the target gate exists for genuinely ambiguous targets.
- A finding whose fix is obvious and inside the authorized mutation boundary is applied and reported in a compact applied-changes list. Question rounds are reserved for genuine forks — scope changes, user-visible tradeoffs, anything hard to reverse — and are batched, up to four questions per round, never one round per finding.
- Optional extras (opening resources, offering the next review or a follow-up phase) never get their own question round at \`session\`/\`hobby\`: fold them into an existing round or a one-line closing offer.

For office-hours specifically: at session or hobby scale, batch the Phase 2B questions (this refines the one-at-a-time rule, whose pressure exists for startup diagnostics), default-skip the Phase 2.75 landscape search, gate the visual sketch and outside design voices on an explicit ask, and cap the Spec Review Loop at one iteration.`,

Two dispatch-infrastructure defects masquerade as a model stall (empty output,

   no suffix (\`mktemp "$TMP_ROOT/codex-err-XXXXXX"\`, never
   \`codex-err-XXXXXX.txt\`). BSD and BusyBox \`mktemp\` require the Xs at the end
   of the template; a suffixed template errors or degrades to a fixed name that
   collides on the next run.
2. **Prompt dispatch.** Never inline a prompt file into argv with
   \`"$(cat "$PROMPT_FILE")"\` — argv length limits and shell quoting differences
   truncate or mangle large prompts. Send the prompt over stdin
   (\`codex exec - < "$PROMPT_FILE"\`, or pipe the same file to \`claude -p\`) so
   the bytes dispatched are exactly the bytes in the scanned file.

    body: `### Codex dispatch consent and redaction gate

Autoplan's dual-voice phases send plan and diff content to OpenAI through the
user's Codex CLI. CLI auth presence is not consent (PRIVACY.md), so "run codex"
is NOT a Mechanical always-yes decision for the first dispatch in a repository.

**One-time per-repo consent.** Before the FIRST Codex dispatch of the run, read
the persisted choice:

\`\`\`bash
eval "$($GSTACK_BIN/gstack-slug 2>/dev/null)"
_CODEX_CONSENT_FILE="\${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/projects/\${PROJECT_ID:-unknown}/codex-consent"
_CODEX_CONSENT=$(cat "$_CODEX_CONSENT_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo unset)
\`\`\`

If it prints \`yes\`, proceed without re-asking. If \`no\`, run Claude-only voices
(same degradation path as a missing Codex binary) and do not re-pitch. If
\`unset\`, ask once via AskUserQuestion — "Autoplan can get a second opinion from
OpenAI Codex. That sends this repository's plan and relevant diff content to
OpenAI using your own Codex login. OK for this repository?" with options
**Yes, for this repo** / **No, Claude-only voices** — persist the answer
(\`mkdir -p "$(dirname "$_CODEX_CONSENT_FILE")" && printf 'yes\\n' > "$_CODEX_CONSENT_FILE"\`,
or \`no\`), and honor it for every later phase and session. The global
\`codex_reviews\` config still wins when set to \`disabled\`.

**Redaction scan at the sink.** Before EVERY Codex dispatch, write the exact
bytes the CLI will carry off-machine (plan content, diff, instructions) to a
temp file and scan that file — never scan a string then re-render it:

\`\`\`bash
REDACT_VIS=$($GSTACK_BIN/gstack-config get redact_repo_visibility 2>/dev/null)
[ -z "$REDACT_VIS" ] && REDACT_VIS=$(gh repo view --json visibility -q .visibility 2>/dev/null | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z')
REDACT_VIS="\${REDACT_VIS:-unknown}"
REDACT_FILE=$(mktemp)
# write the exact dispatch bytes to "$REDACT_FILE" first
$GSTACK_BIN/gstack-redact --from-file "$REDACT_FILE" --repo-visibility "$REDACT_VIS" --self-email "$(git config user.email 2>/dev/null)" --json
\`\`\`

Exit 3 (HIGH): do not dispatch this voice — record the degradation ("codex
skipped: redaction HIGH finding"), tell the user to rotate + redact at source,
and continue Claude-only. HIGH has no skip flag. Exit 2 (MEDIUM):
AskUserQuestion per finding before dispatch (sterner on public repos, no
batch-acknowledge). Exit 0: dispatch, passing the SAME scanned file (or its
verbatim bytes) to the CLI so the bytes scanned are the bytes sent. Delete

the branch diff, any files the CLI reads for context, and the composed prompt.
Before EACH such dispatch (\`codex review\`, \`codex exec\`, or \`claude -p\` with
repo content), run the standard scan-at-sink procedure the specification,
ship, and security-audit workflows already apply to their external sinks:

1. **Materialize what will leave the machine.** For prompt-file dispatches
   (\`cat "$PROMPT_FILE" | claude -p …\`), the prompt file IS the sink bytes —
   scan \`$PROMPT_FILE\` itself and pipe the SAME file after a clean scan. For
   \`codex review\`, the CLI reads the branch diff itself; materialize those
   bytes first (\`git diff origin/<base>...HEAD 2>/dev/null || git diff <base>...HEAD\`,
   plus your prompt text, into a temp file) and scan them before dispatching.
2. **Scan.** Resolve \`$REDACT_VIS\` once (local config \`redact_repo_visibility\`
   → gh → glab → unknown=public-strict), then run
   \`"\${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}/bin/gstack-redact" --from-file "$REDACT_FILE" --repo-visibility "$REDACT_VIS" --self-email "$(git config user.email 2>/dev/null)" --json\`.
3. **Exit 3 (HIGH):** do NOT dispatch. Print the findings, tell the user to
   rotate + redact at source, and stop this outside voice with a typed
   degradation note. HIGH has no skip flag.
4. **Exit 2 (MEDIUM):** AskUserQuestion per finding before dispatching
   (sterner on public repos, no batch-acknowledge, no silent-proceed).
5. **Exit 0 (clean):** dispatch; surface WARN (tool-fence degrades) + LOW as a
   one-line FYI. Delete the temp file afterwards.
