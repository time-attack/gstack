# Compatibility alias: /office-hours

Print this replacement invocation, then dispatch to it exactly:

`$plan --mode Discovery --module office-hours`

Do not reproduce or summarize the retired specialist here. The canonical dispatcher must load its preserved `office-hours` module. If that dispatcher is not installed, tell the user to install it with `npx skills add time-attack/gstack/skills --skill plan`.
