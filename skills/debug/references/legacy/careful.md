# $debug --mode Diagnose-only --module careful — Destructive Command Guardrails

Safety mode is now **active**. Every bash command will be checked for destructive
patterns before running. If a destructive command is detected, you'll be warned
and can choose to proceed or cancel.

Canonical execution does not write engagement analytics or telemetry.

## What's protected

| Pattern | Example | Risk |
|---------|---------|------|
| `rm -rf` / `rm -r` / `rm --recursive` | `rm -rf /var/data` | Recursive delete |
| `DROP TABLE` / `DROP DATABASE` | `DROP TABLE users;` | Data loss |
| `TRUNCATE` | `TRUNCATE orders;` | Data loss |
| `git push --force` / `-f` | `git push -f origin main` | History rewrite |
| `git reset --hard` | `git reset --hard HEAD~3` | Uncommitted work loss |
| `git checkout .` / `git restore .` | `git checkout .` | Uncommitted work loss |
| `kubectl delete` | `kubectl delete pod` | Production impact |
| `docker rm -f` / `docker system prune` | `docker system prune -a` | Container/image loss |

## Safe exceptions

These patterns are allowed without warning:
- `rm -rf node_modules` / `.next` / `dist` / `__pycache__` / `.cache` / `build` / `.turbo` / `coverage`

## How it works

The hook reads the command from the tool input JSON, checks it against the
patterns above, and returns `permissionDecision: "ask"` with a warning message
if a match is found. You can always override the warning and proceed.

To deactivate, end the conversation or start a new one. Hooks are session-scoped.

## Upstream judgment port: PR #679

[Match the user language](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack/pull/679)

### User-language rule

Write questions, progress updates, reports, and artifacts in the language used by the user. Source material, code identifiers, commands, and quotations may remain in their original language when translating them would reduce accuracy.

## Upstream judgment port: issue #879

[Show the content a question refers to before asking it](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack/issues/879)

### Self-contained questions

A question is only answerable if the user can see what it refers to. Before any AskUserQuestion or prose decision brief that asks the user to confirm, approve, rank, or choose among content this session produced — premises, findings, plans, approaches, scores, summaries — render that content in full as direct assistant text immediately before the question, or restate it inside the question and option descriptions. Internal reasoning is invisible to the user, and collapsed tool output (Bash cat, Read) does not count as shown. Never ask "do you agree with the N premises?" when the premises exist only in your reasoning: print them, then ask. This generalizes the inline design-doc approval rule from PR #1116 to every question in every workflow.
