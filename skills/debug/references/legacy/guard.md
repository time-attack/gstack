## Host-neutral runtime bindings

These assignments select stable paths only; they do not install anything or grant consent:

```bash
GSTACK_HOME="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}"
GSTACK_ROOT="$GSTACK_HOME"
GSTACK_STATE_ROOT="$GSTACK_HOME"
GSTACK_BIN="$GSTACK_HOME/bin"
BUN_CMD="$GSTACK_BIN/bun"
B="$GSTACK_BIN/browse"
P="$GSTACK_BIN/make-pdf"

# $debug --mode Diagnose-only --module guard — Full Safety Mode

Activates both destructive command warnings and directory-scoped edit restrictions.
This is the combination of `$debug --mode Diagnose-only --module careful` + `$debug --mode Diagnose-only --module freeze` in a single command.

**Dependency note:** This skill references hook scripts from the sibling `$debug --mode Diagnose-only --module careful`
and `$debug --mode Diagnose-only --module freeze` skill directories. Both must be installed (they are installed together
by the gstack setup script).

Canonical execution does not write engagement analytics or telemetry.

## Setup

Ask the user which directory to restrict edits to. Use AskUserQuestion:

- Question: "Guard mode: which directory should edits be restricted to? Destructive command warnings are always on. Files outside the chosen path will be blocked from editing."
- Text input (not multiple choice) — the user types a path.

Once the user provides a directory path:

1. Resolve it to an absolute path:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR=$(cd "<user-provided-path>" 2>/dev/null && pwd)
echo "$FREEZE_DIR"
```

2. Ensure trailing slash and save to the freeze state file:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR="${FREEZE_DIR%/}/"
eval "$($GSTACK_BIN/gstack-paths 2>/dev/null)"
STATE_DIR="$GSTACK_STATE_ROOT"
mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR"
echo "$FREEZE_DIR" > "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
echo "Freeze boundary set: $FREEZE_DIR"
```

Tell the user:
- "**Guard mode active.** Two protections are now running:"
- "1. **Destructive command warnings** — rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push, etc. will warn before executing (you can override)"
- "2. **Edit boundary** — file edits restricted to `<path>/`. Edits outside this directory are blocked."
- "To remove the edit boundary, run `$debug --mode Diagnose-only --module unfreeze`. To deactivate everything, end the session."

## What's protected

See `$debug --mode Diagnose-only --module careful` for the full list of destructive command patterns and safe exceptions.
See `$debug --mode Diagnose-only --module freeze` for how edit boundary enforcement works.

[Match the user language](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack/pull/679)

### User-language rule

Write questions, progress updates, reports, and artifacts in the language used by the user. Source material, code identifiers, commands, and quotations may remain in their original language when translating them would reduce accuracy.

## Upstream judgment port: issue #879

[Show the content a question refers to before asking it](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack/issues/879)

### Self-contained questions

A question is only answerable if the user can see what it refers to. Before any AskUserQuestion or prose decision brief that asks the user to confirm, approve, rank, or choose among content this session produced — premises, findings, plans, approaches, scores, summaries — render that content in full as direct assistant text immediately before the question, or restate it inside the question and option descriptions. Internal reasoning is invisible to the user, and collapsed tool output (Bash cat, Read) does not count as shown. Never ask "do you agree with the N premises?" when the premises exist only in your reasoning: print them, then ask. This generalizes the inline design-doc approval rule from PR #1116 to every question in every workflow.
