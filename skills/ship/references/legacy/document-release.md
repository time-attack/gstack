## Host-neutral runtime bindings

These assignments select stable paths only; they do not install anything or grant consent:

```bash
GSTACK_HOME="${GSTACK_HOME:-$HOME/.gstack}"
GSTACK_ROOT="$GSTACK_HOME"
GSTACK_STATE_ROOT="$GSTACK_HOME"
GSTACK_BIN="$GSTACK_HOME/bin"
BUN_CMD="$GSTACK_BIN/bun"
B="$GSTACK_BIN/browse"
P="$GSTACK_BIN/make-pdf"
```
## Step 0: Detect platform and base branch

First resolve the repository's own remote as `<remote>` using
`references/BASE-DETECTION.md` — never assume `origin` exists, and empty means a
local-only repo, which is a supported case. Then detect the git hosting platform
from that remote's URL:

```bash
git remote get-url <remote> 2>/dev/null
```

- If the URL contains "github.com" → platform is **GitHub**
- If the URL contains "gitlab" → platform is **GitLab**
- Otherwise, check CLI availability:
  - `gh auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitHub** (covers GitHub Enterprise)
  - `glab auth status 2>/dev/null` succeeds → platform is **GitLab** (covers self-hosted)
  - Neither → **unknown** (use git-native commands only)

Determine which branch this PR/MR targets, or the repo's default branch if no
PR/MR exists. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

Resolve the remote and the base branch with the order in
`references/BASE-DETECTION.md`: a base the user named, then the open PR/MR
target, the remote's own HEAD, the platform CLI's default branch, the local
default branch, the current branch's upstream, and finally "no separate base
branch" scoped to the working tree. Stop at the first candidate that
`git rev-parse --verify` confirms exists. Never substitute a hardcoded `main`,
`master`, or `origin/main`, and never assume the remote is named `origin`.

Print the detected remote (or "none") and the detected base branch name. In every
subsequent `git diff`, `git log`, `git fetch`, `git merge`, and PR/MR creation
command, substitute the detected branch name wherever the instructions say "the
base branch" or `<default>`, and the detected remote wherever they say
`<remote>`.

# Document Release: Post-Ship Documentation Update

You are running the `$ship --mode Prepare --module document-release` workflow. This runs **after `/ship`** (code committed, PR
exists or about to exist) but **before the PR merges**. Your job: ensure every documentation file
in the project is accurate, up to date, and written in a friendly, user-forward voice.

You are mostly automated. Make obvious factual updates directly. Stop and ask only for risky or
subjective decisions.

**Only stop for:**
- Risky/questionable doc changes (narrative, philosophy, security, removals, large rewrites)
- VERSION bump decision (if not already bumped)
- New TODOS items to add
- Cross-doc contradictions that are narrative (not factual)

**Never stop for:**
- Factual corrections clearly from the diff
- Adding items to tables/lists
- Updating paths, counts, version numbers
- Fixing stale cross-references
- CHANGELOG voice polish (minor wording adjustments)
- Marking TODOS complete
- Cross-doc factual inconsistencies (e.g., version number mismatch)

**NEVER do:**
- Overwrite, replace, or regenerate CHANGELOG entries — polish wording only, preserve all content
- Bump VERSION without asking — always use AskUserQuestion for version changes
- Use `Write` tool on CHANGELOG.md — always use `Edit` with exact `old_string` matches

---

---

## Step 1: Pre-flight & Diff Analysis

1. Check the current branch. If on the base branch, **abort**: "You're on the base branch. Run from a feature branch."

2. Gather context about what changed:

```bash
git diff <base>...HEAD --stat
```

```bash
git log <base>..HEAD --oneline
```

```bash
git diff <base>...HEAD --name-only
```

3. Discover all documentation files in the repo:

```bash
find . -maxdepth 2 -name "*.md" -not -path "./.git/*" -not -path "./node_modules/*" -not -path "./.gstack/*" -not -path "./.context/*" | sort
```

4. Classify the changes into categories relevant to documentation:
   - **New features** — new files, new commands, new skills, new capabilities
   - **Changed behavior** — modified services, updated APIs, config changes
   - **Removed functionality** — deleted files, removed commands
   - **Infrastructure** — build system, test infrastructure, CI

5. Output a brief summary: "Analyzing N files changed across M commits. Found K documentation files to review."

---

## Step 1.5: Coverage Map (Blast-Radius Analysis)

Before touching any documentation file, build a **coverage map** of what shipped vs what's
documented. This is inspired by the Diataxis framework (tutorial / how-to / reference / explanation)
— but applied as an audit lens, not a generation tool.

1. **Extract public surface changes from the diff.** Scan `git diff <base>...HEAD` for:
   - New exported functions, classes, commands, CLI flags, config options, API endpoints
   - New skills, workflows, or user-facing capabilities
   - Renamed or removed public surface (modules, commands, features)
   - New environment variables, feature flags, or configuration knobs

2. **For each new/changed public surface item, assess documentation coverage:**

```
Coverage map:
  [entity]         [reference?] [how-to?] [tutorial?] [explanation?]
  /new-skill       ✅ AGENTS.md  ❌        ❌          ❌
  --new-flag       ✅ README     ✅ README  ❌          ❌
  FooProcessor     ❌            ❌        ❌          ❌
```

Use these definitions:
- **Reference** — factual description of what it is, its API, its options (README tables, AGENTS.md skill lists, API docs)
- **How-to** — task-oriented: "how to do X with this" (README examples, CONTRIBUTING workflows)
- **Tutorial** — learning-oriented: step-by-step walkthrough for newcomers (getting started guides)
- **Explanation** — understanding-oriented: "why this works this way" (ARCHITECTURE decisions, design rationale)

3. **Output the coverage map.** Items with zero coverage are **critical gaps** — flag them for
   Step 3. Items with reference-only coverage are **common gaps** — note them for the PR body.

4. **Architecture diagram drift detection.** If ARCHITECTURE.md (or any doc) contains ASCII
   diagrams or Mermaid blocks, extract entity names (modules, services, data flows) from the
   diagrams. Cross-reference against the diff. Flag any diagram entities that were renamed,
   split, removed, or moved in the code.

The coverage map feeds into Steps 2-3 (what to audit and fix) and Step 9 (documentation debt
summary in the PR body). Do NOT auto-generate missing documentation pages — flag gaps only.
When significant gaps are found, suggest running `$ship --mode Prepare --module document-generate` to fill them.

---

## Lazy specialist phase: release-body

When the workflow reaches this phase, read `references/sections/document-release/release-body.md` completely and execute it before continuing. Do not summarize or skip its questions, pressure, gates, evidence, artifacts, mutation boundary, or exit behavior.

---

## Important Rules

- **Read before editing.** Always read the full content of a file before modifying it.
- **Never clobber CHANGELOG.** Polish wording only. Never delete, replace, or regenerate entries.
- **Never bump VERSION silently.** Always ask. Even if already bumped, check whether it covers the full scope of changes.
- **Be explicit about what changed.** Every edit gets a one-line summary.
- **Generic heuristics, not project-specific.** The audit checks work on any repo.
- **Discoverability matters.** Every doc file should be reachable from README or CLAUDE.md.
- **Coverage map informs, never generates.** The Diataxis coverage map flags gaps for the PR body
  and future work. It does NOT auto-generate missing documentation pages or sections. When gaps
  are found, suggest `$ship --mode Prepare --module document-generate` as the follow-up skill.
- **Diagram drift is advisory.** Flag stale architecture diagrams in the PR body but do not
  auto-edit ASCII art or Mermaid blocks — they require human judgment to update correctly.
- **Voice: friendly, user-forward, not obscure.** Write like you're explaining to a smart person
  who hasn't seen the code.

[Show the content a question refers to before asking it](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack/issues/879)

### Self-contained questions

A question is only answerable if the user can see what it refers to. Before any AskUserQuestion or prose decision brief that asks the user to confirm, approve, rank, or choose among content this session produced — premises, findings, plans, approaches, scores, summaries — render that content in full as direct assistant text immediately before the question, or restate it inside the question and option descriptions. Internal reasoning is invisible to the user, and collapsed tool output (Bash cat, Read) does not count as shown. Never ask "do you agree with the N premises?" when the premises exist only in your reasoning: print them, then ask. This generalizes the inline design-doc approval rule from PR #1116 to every question in every workflow.

## Upstream judgment port: issue #1079

[External effects must not fail or lie: REST PR mutations, sandbox canary, no-runtime discipline](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack/issues/1079)

### External effects that fail or lie

1. **PR mutations use the REST API.** The gh CLI's high-level PR-edit
   subcommand rides a GraphQL mutation that hard-errors under fine-grained
   tokens and several permission setups. Every PR title/body/base mutation
   uses the one canonical form:
   `gh api -X PATCH "repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)" -f title=… | -F body=@<file>`
   (full block in `references/EXTERNAL-EFFECTS.md`).
2. **A second-opinion pass must prove it ran.** On a Linux host without user
   namespaces, Codex's bwrap sandbox cannot start and the pass silently
   no-ops. Before crediting any Codex pass as review evidence, source
   `$GSTACK_BIN/gstack-codex-probe` and run `_gstack_codex_sandbox_canary`
   once per session; `CODEX_SANDBOX_UNAVAILABLE` is a typed, fail-closed
   result — record "codex skipped: sandbox unavailable" and continue without
   that voice. An empty or failed pass is never reported as a clean review.
3. **The effects discipline binds without the runtime.** When the optional
   runtime is absent, print each effect key and exact command as assistant
   text before executing it directly; on interruption or ambiguity, STOP and
   inspect the external system. Never retry automatically; never re-run an
   effect whose outcome is unknown.
