# $ship --mode Deploy --module setup-deploy — Configure Deployment for gstack

You are helping the user configure their deployment so `$ship --mode Land --module land-and-deploy` works
automatically. Your job is to detect the deploy platform, production URL, health
checks, and deploy status commands — then persist everything to CLAUDE.md.

After this runs once, `$ship --mode Land --module land-and-deploy` reads CLAUDE.md and skips detection entirely.

## User-invocable
When the user types `$ship --mode Deploy --module setup-deploy`, run this skill.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check existing configuration

```bash
grep -A 20 "## Deploy Configuration" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_CONFIG"
```

If configuration already exists, show it and ask:

- **Context:** Deploy configuration already exists in CLAUDE.md.
- **RECOMMENDATION:** Choose A to update if your setup changed.
- A) Reconfigure from scratch (overwrite existing)
- B) Edit specific fields (show current config, let me change one thing)
- C) Done — configuration looks correct

If the user picks C, stop.

### Step 2: Detect platform

Run the platform detection from the deploy bootstrap:

```bash
# Platform config files
[ -f fly.toml ] && echo "PLATFORM:fly" && cat fly.toml
[ -f render.yaml ] && echo "PLATFORM:render" && cat render.yaml
[ -f vercel.json ] || [ -d .vercel ] && echo "PLATFORM:vercel"
[ -f netlify.toml ] && echo "PLATFORM:netlify" && cat netlify.toml
[ -f Procfile ] && echo "PLATFORM:heroku"
[ -f railway.json ] || [ -f railway.toml ] && echo "PLATFORM:railway"

# GitHub Actions deploy workflows
for f in $(find .github/workflows -maxdepth 1 \( -name '*.yml' -o -name '*.yaml' \) 2>/dev/null); do
  [ -f "$f" ] && grep -qiE "deploy|release|production|staging|cd" "$f" 2>/dev/null && echo "DEPLOY_WORKFLOW:$f"
done

# Project type
[ -f package.json ] && grep -q '"bin"' package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "PROJECT_TYPE:cli"
find . -maxdepth 1 -name '*.gemspec' 2>/dev/null | grep -q . && echo "PROJECT_TYPE:library"
```

### Step 3: Platform-specific setup

Based on what was detected, guide the user through platform-specific configuration.

#### Fly.io

If `fly.toml` detected:

1. Extract app name: `grep -m1 "^app" fly.toml | sed 's/app = "\(.*\)"/\1/'`
2. Check if `fly` CLI is installed: `which fly 2>/dev/null`
3. If installed, verify: `fly status --app {app} 2>/dev/null`
4. Infer URL: `https://{app}.fly.dev`
5. Set deploy status command: `fly status --app {app}`
6. Set health check: `https://{app}.fly.dev` (or `$review --mode Deep --module health` if the app has one)

Ask the user to confirm the production URL. Some Fly apps use custom domains.

#### Render

If `render.yaml` detected:

1. Extract service name and type from render.yaml
2. Check for Render API key without printing any of it: `[ -n "$RENDER_API_KEY" ] && echo "RENDER_API_KEY: set" || echo "RENDER_API_KEY: missing"` (never echo key bytes, even a prefix)
3. Infer URL: `https://{service-name}.onrender.com`
4. Render deploys automatically on push to the connected branch — no deploy workflow needed
5. Set health check: the inferred URL

Ask the user to confirm. Render uses auto-deploy from the connected git branch — after
merge to main, Render picks it up automatically. The "deploy wait" in $ship --mode Land --module land-and-deploy
should poll the Render URL until it responds with the new version.

#### Vercel

If vercel.json or .vercel detected:

1. Check for `vercel` CLI: `which vercel 2>/dev/null`
2. If installed: `vercel ls --prod 2>/dev/null | head -3`
3. Vercel deploys automatically on push — preview on PR, production on merge to main
4. Set health check: the production URL from vercel project settings

#### Netlify

If netlify.toml detected:

1. Extract site info from netlify.toml
2. Netlify deploys automatically on push
3. Set health check: the production URL

#### GitHub Actions only

If deploy workflows detected but no platform config:

1. Read the workflow file to understand what it does
2. Extract the deploy target (if mentioned)
3. Ask the user for the production URL

#### Custom / Manual

If nothing detected:

Use AskUserQuestion to gather the information:

1. **How are deploys triggered?**
   - A) Automatically on push to main (Fly, Render, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   - B) Via GitHub Actions workflow
   - C) Via a deploy script or CLI command (describe it)
   - D) Manually (SSH, dashboard, etc.)
   - E) This project doesn't deploy (library, CLI, tool)

2. **What's the production URL?** (Free text — the URL where the app runs)

3. **How can gstack check if a deploy succeeded?**
   - A) HTTP health check at a specific URL (e.g., $review --mode Deep --module health, /api/status)
   - B) CLI command (e.g., `fly status`, `kubectl rollout status`)
   - C) Check the GitHub Actions workflow status
   - D) No automated way — just check the URL loads

4. **Any pre-merge or post-merge hooks?**
   - Commands to run before merging (e.g., `bun run build`)
   - Commands to run after merge but before deploy verification

### Step 4: Write configuration

Read CLAUDE.md (or create it). Find and replace the `## Deploy Configuration` section
if it exists, or append it at the end.

```markdown
## Deploy Configuration (configured by $ship --mode Deploy --module setup-deploy)
- Platform: {platform}
- Production URL: {url}
- Deploy workflow: {workflow file or "auto-deploy on push"}
- Deploy status command: {command or "HTTP health check"}
- Merge method: {squash/merge/rebase}
- Project type: {web app / API / CLI / library}
- Post-deploy health check: {health check URL or command}

### Custom deploy hooks
- Pre-merge: {command or "none"}
- Deploy trigger: {command or "automatic on push to main"}
- Deploy status: {command or "poll production URL"}
- Health check: {URL or command}
```

### Step 5: Verify

After writing, verify the configuration works:

1. If a health check URL was configured, try it:
```bash
curl -sf "{health-check-url}" -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" 2>/dev/null || echo "UNREACHABLE"
```

2. If a deploy status command was configured, try it:
```bash
{deploy-status-command} 2>/dev/null | head -5 || echo "COMMAND_FAILED"
```

Report results. If anything failed, note it but don't block — the config is still
useful even if the health check is temporarily unreachable.

### Step 6: Summary

```
DEPLOY CONFIGURATION — COMPLETE
════════════════════════════════
Platform:      {platform}
URL:           {url}
Health check:  {health check}
Status cmd:    {status command}
Merge method:  {merge method}

Saved to CLAUDE.md. $ship --mode Land --module land-and-deploy will use these settings automatically.

Next steps:
- Run $ship --mode Land --module land-and-deploy to merge and deploy your current PR
- Edit the "## Deploy Configuration" section in CLAUDE.md to change settings
- Run $ship --mode Deploy --module setup-deploy again to reconfigure
```

## Important Rules

- **Never expose secrets.** Don't print full API keys, tokens, or passwords.
- **Confirm with the user.** Always show the detected config and ask for confirmation before writing.
- **CLAUDE.md is the source of truth.** All configuration lives there — not in a separate config file.
- **Idempotent.** Running $ship --mode Deploy --module setup-deploy multiple times overwrites the previous config cleanly.
- **Platform CLIs are optional.** If `fly` or `vercel` CLI isn't installed, fall back to URL-based health checks.

## Upstream judgment port: PR #679

[Match the user language](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack/pull/679)

### User-language rule

Write questions, progress updates, reports, and artifacts in the language used by the user. Source material, code identifiers, commands, and quotations may remain in their original language when translating them would reduce accuracy.

## Upstream judgment port: issue #879

[Show the content a question refers to before asking it](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack/issues/879)

### Self-contained questions

A question is only answerable if the user can see what it refers to. Before any AskUserQuestion or prose decision brief that asks the user to confirm, approve, rank, or choose among content this session produced — premises, findings, plans, approaches, scores, summaries — render that content in full as direct assistant text immediately before the question, or restate it inside the question and option descriptions. Internal reasoning is invisible to the user, and collapsed tool output (Bash cat, Read) does not count as shown. Never ask "do you agree with the N premises?" when the premises exist only in your reasoning: print them, then ask. This generalizes the inline design-doc approval rule from PR #1116 to every question in every workflow.

## Upstream judgment port: issue #1078

[Verify deploy credentials without echoing any key bytes](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack/issues/1078)

### Credential presence check without byte echo

Never print any bytes of a credential to the transcript, logs, or shell
history — not even a prefix. Echoing the key variable through `head -c 4`
leaks four real key bytes into a transcript that may be shared, screenshotted,
or persisted. Verify presence only:

```bash
[ -n "$RENDER_API_KEY" ] && echo "RENDER_API_KEY: set" || echo "RENDER_API_KEY: missing"
```

The same rule applies to every provider credential this workflow touches
(Fly, Vercel, Netlify tokens): presence and validity are checked by a
non-mutating API call, never by printing key material.
